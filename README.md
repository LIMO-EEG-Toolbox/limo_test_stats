# limo test stats

This repository contains the functions used to test the statistical functions in LIMO tools.

# what tests

Two types of tests peformed:  
- unit tests which runs the code base against ground truth data (ie know expected results)
- simulations and data driven approach which test peformances ensuring LIMO does what it is supposed to do to control outliers, error rates, etc
